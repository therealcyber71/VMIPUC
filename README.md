# VMIPUC LMS Android App
An APK file with the website embed.

## Why does this repo exist?
There was no mobile app for a Learning Management System my school used, and our notes and other documents were shared there, since not everyone had a PC and website viewing is hard on mobile phones, I decided to use [this](https://www.webintoapp.com/app-maker) tool. You can view PDFs and other notifications, etc easily with the help of this mobile app.

## How to install
Download this repo onto your phone from this site, then open the zip file, and head to the `android` folder. \
Select the second file, `app-release.apk` and download it. \
The download will probably be stopped because the APK file isn't verified by google or the playstore, don't worry, the files are 100% safe! 
Once dowdnloaded, you can open it like any other app, login using your credentials. All the documents, reminders, etc can be found there.

## Drawbacks
1. Zoom cannot be accessed (Not tested)
2. Please open an issue to report a bug!

## Why is it not on Playstore?
I'm broke, I need to pay 25 dollars to get the app on playstore, it's open source, so anyone can install it and use it without having to pay.
