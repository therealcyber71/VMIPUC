## Why does this repo exist?
There was no mobile app for a Learning Management System my school used, and our notes and other documents were shared there, since not everyone had a PC and website viewing is hard on mobile phones, I decided to use [this](https://www.webintoapp.com/app-maker) tool. You can view PDFs and other notifications, etc easily with the help of this mobile app.

## How to install
Download this repo onto your phone from this site, then open the zip file, and head to the `android` folder. \
Select the second file, `app-release.apk` and download it. \
The download will probably be stopped because the APK file isn't verified by google or the playstore, don't worry, the files are 100% safe! 
Once dowdnloaded, you can open it like any other app, login using your credentials. All the documents, reminders, etc can be found there.


Alternatively:
Download it from [this](https://megafile.cc/8y1q/vmipuc-lms-10.zip) link. 

Download the zip file from this link, open the zip file after extraction, go to the `android` folder, select the second file `app-release.apk`, install it, close the browser, open the app and use it like any other app. Playstore will stop you from downloading, the files are 100 percent safe and hence can be downloaded without having to bother about dafety.

## Drawbacks
1. Zoom cannot be accessed (Not tested)
2. Please open an issue to report a bug!

## Why is it not on Playstore?
I'm broke, I need to pay 25 dollars to get the app on playstore, it's open source, so anyone can install it and use it without having to pay.
